🛠 Prompt to Build a Network Penetration Tutorial App with Flask on Replit
Step 1: Create the Replit Project

Go to Replit:

Visit Replit
.

Create a New Repl:

Click on the "+ Create" button.

Choose Flask as the template for the app (this will set up a Python web app).

Name your Repl something like "Network Penetration Guides & Tools".

Step 2: Set Up Your Folder Structure

In your Replit file tree, create the following structure:

network-pen-guides/
│
├── app.py
├── scraper.py
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── icons/
│   │   └── tutorial_images/
│   └── js/
│       └── service-worker.js
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── admin.html
│   ├── edit.html
│   └── tutorials/
│       └── (tutorial HTML files will be stored here)
├── data/
│   └── tutorials.db  (SQLite database to store tutorials)
├── static/
│   └── manifest.json  (PWA manifest)
└── requirements.txt

Step 3: Install Required Libraries

In Replit, go to the "Packages" tab on the left panel.

Add the following dependencies to your requirements.txt:

flask==2.2.3
requests==2.28.1
beautifulsoup4==4.11.1
sqlite3==3.36.0

Step 4: Develop Core App (app.py)

Set Up the Flask App:

Your app.py will handle routes for displaying tutorials, the admin panel, and editing or deleting content.

This will use SQLite for storing tutorial metadata and file paths.

Create Routes:

Index Route: Displays a list of tutorials.

Tutorial Route: Opens a specific tutorial based on a slug.

Admin Panel: Allows an admin (via a hidden route) to manage (edit/delete) tutorials.

Step 5: Scrape Tutorials (scraper.py)

Scrape Tutorial Metadata:

Use BeautifulSoup to scrape content from your website (e.g., https://www.hackingarticles.in/
).

Download tutorial images and save them to the local static/images/tutorials folder.

Save tutorial data (title, description, slug, and HTML file) in the SQLite database tutorials.db.

Store HTML Files:

Save each tutorial’s HTML content in the templates/tutorials folder so it can be rendered in Flask.

Step 6: PWA Setup

Create the manifest.json File:

Add metadata for your app (e.g., icons, name, theme color).

This file should be located in the static folder.

Set Up Service Worker (service-worker.js):

Cache your app’s resources (like CSS, JS, images) so it works offline.

Add logic for handling installation, activation, and fetching from cache.

Modify HTML Templates:

Add a reference to manifest.json and register the service worker in base.html.

Include a theme color and a favicon for the PWA.

Step 7: Build the UI

Design the Layout:

Use Bootstrap for responsive design.

The index page should list tutorials in cards with a title, image, and brief description.

Tutorial pages should display the full content of the tutorial, along with the image.

Admin Panel:

Add a hidden admin panel route where the admin can edit or delete tutorials.

Create forms for editing tutorial metadata and deleting content.

Use CSS to Style:

Add custom styling (colors, fonts, button styles) in static/css/style.css.

Step 8: Implement Tutorial Management in Admin Panel

Admin Panel:

Provide options to edit the title and description of the tutorials.

Allow the admin to delete tutorials (both metadata and associated HTML files).

SQLite Database:

Use the SQLite database to store tutorial metadata (title, description, image path, HTML filename).

Handle the addition of new tutorials, updating existing tutorials, and deleting tutorials.

Step 9: Testing & Debugging

Test the PWA Features:

Open the app in a mobile device simulator or real device.

Ensure the PWA installation prompt shows up and the app works offline.

Test Admin Features:

Try adding, editing, and deleting tutorials from the admin panel.

Ensure that changes reflect in the app and the tutorial database.

Step 10: Deploy the Flask App

Run the App:

Click on the Run button on Replit.

Ensure that the app is accessible, and the database works correctly.

Deploy to Production:

You can deploy your Flask app to Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for production use.

Make sure you set up SSL for HTTPS, as PWA requires the app to be served over a secure connection.

Final Deliverables:

A Progressive Web App that:

Allows users to browse tutorials offline.

Has a modern, responsive UI using Bootstrap.

Allows an admin to manage tutorials (add, edit, delete) without login.

SQLite Database to store tutorial information.

PWA functionality: Service worker for offline support and a manifest for installation.
